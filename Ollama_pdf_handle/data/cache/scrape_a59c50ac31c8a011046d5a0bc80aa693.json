Known as object detection in a gist, this vision simulation designed with\n image recognition software \nhas passed the baton of vision and sight to computers. \nThe primary purpose of object detection is to segment, localize and annotate physical or digital objects with foolproof precision to complete a designated task at hand.\n\n\nObject detection has opened new pathways of robotic assistance which is aimed at manufacturing self-assist devices to ease tedious tasks.  Let's learn about that in detail.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is object detection?\n\n\nObject detection is a \nnarrow AI \napproach that identifies, classifies, and locates objects in digital photographs or videos. The main goal of object detection is to detect the instances of each object, segment them, and analyze their necessary features for real-time categorization and in-depth modularity. \n\n\n\n\nObject detection is a part of the overall \ndatabase architecture\n of a company. Some businesses have successfully adopted this technology while others are waiting for them to announce it as a successful database management technique.\n\n\nMajor examples of object detection include security and surveillance, access control, biometric attendance, road condition monitoring, self-assist machines, and marine border protection.\n\n\n\n\nHow does object detection work?\n\n\nObject detection works \nsimilarly to \nobject recognition\n. The only difference is that object recognition is the process of identifying the correct object category,\n whereas object detection simply detects the object's presence and location in an image.\n\n\nObject detection tasks can be performed using two different data analysis techniques. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage processing \nis a part of \nunsupervised learning\n that doesn't require historical\n training data \nto teach analytics models. The models self-train themselves on the input images and create feature maps to make predictions. Image processing does not require high graphical processing power or large datasets for execution.\n\n\n\n\nDeep neural network: \nA deep neural network is generally a \nsupervised learning \nalgorithm that requires large datasets and high GPU computation power to predict object classes. It’s a more accurate way to classify partially hidden, complex objects, or placed in unknown backgrounds in an image.\n\n\n\n\nTraining a deep neural network is a labor-intensive and expensive task. However, some large-scale datasets provide the availability of labeled data.\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?  \nCOCO\n, a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset, can be used to train a deep neural network.\n\n\n \n\n\nSome features you can expect from MS COCO: \n\n\n\n\nObject segmentation\n\n\nRecognition in context\n\n\nSuperpixel stuff segmentation\n\n\nPretrained on 33OK images\n\n\n1.5 million object instances\n\n\n80 object classes\n\n\n91 stuff categories\n\n\n5 captions per image\n\n\n250,000 people with key points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to learn more about Image Recognition Software? \n\nExplore Image Recognition products.\n\n\n\n\nObject detection importance\n\n\nHaving understood the working methodology, it’s time to discuss what makes object detection important.\n\n\nObject detection forms the basis for other important AI vision techniques, such as image classification, image retrieval, \nimage processing\n, or object co-segmentation, which extract meaningful information from real-life objects. Developers and engineers are using these techniques to build futuristic machines that deliver groceries and medicines to our doorsteps!\n\n\nAn object detection algorithm can automatically detect cattle movements, traffic signals, and road lanes so self-driving vehicles can reach their destinations. This, in turn, eliminates the need for drivers to run logistic errands.\n\n\nSource\n: \ngeeksforgeeks\n\n\nObject detection can also run on mobile networks by pruning the layers of a \ndeep neural network\n. It is already being used in security scanners or metal detectors at airports to detect unwanted and illegal objects.\n\n\nApart from this, businesses use object detection for people counting, number plate recognition, \nspeech recognition\n, and evidence detection.  However, a slight lack of accuracy sometimes hampers its efficiency in detecting minute objects. A lack of cent percent accuracy makes it less preferable for critical domains like mining and the military.\n\n\n\n\nImage classification vs. object detection\n\n\nObject detection is often confused with image classification. While these are the sides of the same Rubik's cube, here are some notable differences.\n\n\n\n\nImage classification\n is a simple concept of categorizing a multispectral image based on its components. If you’re given an image of a dog, the image classification model can interpret its core features and label the image as a “dog” easily. If an image contains two objects, like a cat and a dog, the model uses a multi-label classifier to classify both these objects.\n\n\nThe image classification model doesn’t accept any variable for object localization other than defining the object class. This is where object detection steps in. \n\n\nAn \nobject detection \nalgorithm can identify the object class and predict the exact location of the objects in an image by drawing bounding boxes around them. It’s a combination of image classification and object localization that enables the system to know where objects are placed in an image and why. It powers a system to visually analyze each object and determine its real-life application, just like humans do.\n\n\n\n\nObject detection models\n\n\nThe most preferred approaches to \nobject detection are \nmachine learning\n or deep learning. Both methods work in conjunction with a \nsupport vector machine\n (SVM) to \nextract the features\n, train the algorithm,\n and categorize objects.\n\n\nObject detection is not possible without a proper dataset. Datasets cover an object's major known features, such as location, dimensions, category, or colors. In practice, if an object detection model is pre-trained on a dataset of something with wheels, a windshield, blinkers, an engine, and a trunk, it can accurately classify the object in the given image as a car.\n\n\nDifferent types of object detection methods have different levels of effectiveness and applicability across industries. Let’s understand this in detail :\n\n\nMachine learning \n\n\nThe plus point of using a \nmachine learning algorithm\n to perform object detection is that it relies on manually entered data for classification, not automatic training data. This makes the overall algorithm less error-prone and more stable. \n\n\nObject detection is a supervised machine-learning problem, meaning you must use pre-trained models to trigger object detectors. The list of classes in the training dataset of an ML algorithm must belong to a specific image or list of images. \n\n\nMachine learning approaches like \nnatural language processing\n (NLP) identify and classify objects based on their illumination intensity against a backdrop. ML algorithms for 2D objects can also be reused to detect 3D objects in images.\n\n\nAggregate channel features (ACF)\n\n\nACF is a machine learning method that recognizes specific objects in an image based on a training image dataset and the objects' ground locations. It is mainly used for multi-view object detection, such as identifying 3D objects captured from three camera rigs. Self-assist vehicles, pedestrian detection, and \nface detection\n work on this principle.\n\n\nACF combines different channels that extract features from an image as gradients or pixels rather than cropping an image in various locations. Common channels include gray-scale or RBG, depending on the difficulty of the object detection problem. ACF gives you a richer understanding of objects and accelerates detection speed for higher accuracy.\n\n\n\n\nTip: \nT\no create an ACF object detector, declare and define a MATLAB programming function, “\ntrainACFObjectDetector()\n” and load the training images. Test the detection accuracy on a separate test image.\n\n\n\n\nDPM object detection\n\n\nThe deformable parts model (DPM) is a machine-learning approach that recognizes objects with a mixture of graphical models and deformable parts of the image. It contains four major components: \n\n\n\n\nA coarse root filter defines several bounding boxes in an image to capture the objects.\n\n\nPart filters cover the fragments of the objects and turn them into arrows of darker pixels.\n\n\nA spatial model stores the location of all the object fragments relative to bounding boxes in the root filter.\n\n\nA regressor decreases the distance between bounding boxes and ground truth to predict objects accurately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: \nlilianweng.github.io/\n\n\n\n\nTip: \nExtracting important features of salient objects can be useful while collecting data from construction sites to track work progress or enforce \nenvironmental health and safety\n during work.\n\n\n\n\nDeep learning\n\n\nWhile machine learning models are built on manual selection of the features, \ndeep learning\n workflows come with automatic feature selection to suit your tech stack. Deep learning approaches like convolutional neural network models produce faster and more accurate object predictions. Of course, you need a higher graphics processing unit (GPU) and larger datasets for that to happen!\n\n\nDeep learning is used for a variety of object detection tasks. Modern-day video surveillance cameras or monitoring systems are powered by neural networks to successfully detect unknown faces or objects.\n\n\nHere are some deep-learning approaches to tackle object detection. \n\n\nYou Only Look Once (YOLO)\n\n\nYOLO is a single-stage object detection framework dedicated to industrial applications. Its efficient design and high performance make it hardware-friendly and efficient. It’s a CNN trained on large visual databases like image nets and can be coded in open-source editors in TensorFlow, Darknet, or Python. \n\n\nYOLO produces state-of-the-art object detections at a lightning-fast 45 frames per second. To date, different versions of YOLO, such as YOLOv1, YOLOv2, or YOLOv3,\n have been launched.\n \nThe latest version, YOLOv6, can be trained on custom datasets in PyTorch via \napplication programming interfaces (APIs)\n. Pytorch is a Python package and one of the most preferred forms of deep learning research. YOLOv6 is exclusively trained to detect moving vehicles on the road.\n\n\n\n\nDid you know? \nYOLO or region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) use the mean average precision or mAP() function. It compares a ground-bounding box to an actual detected box and returns a probability or confidence score. The higher the score, the more accurate the prediction.\n\n\n\n\nSSD (Single Shot Detector)\n\n\nSSD is a custom object detector with no specific region proposal network (different parts of an image clubbed together in a network) for object prediction. It predicts an image's location and type of object directly in one single pass through a range of layers of a deep learning model. \n\n\nSSD is bifurcated into two parts :\n\n\n1. Backbone \n\n\nThe backbone of the pre-trained image classification network extracts the features from the image to identify the image. These networks, like ResNet, are trained on ImageNets ( large image databases) and separated from the internal image classification layer. It leaves the backbone model as a deep neural network, solely trained on millions of images to extract semantic information from the input image while preserving the spatial structure of the image.\nFor ResNet34, the backbone creates 256x7x7 feature maps for any input image.\n\n\n2. Head\n\nThe head of the object detection model is just a neural network brain layer added to the backbone that helps in the final regression process of the image. It outputs the spatial location of the object and combines it with the object class in the final SSD stages.\n\n\n\n\nSource:\ndevelopers.arcgis.com\n\n\n\n\nOther important components \n\n\n\n\nHere are the important components that make up an SSD model to perform object detection in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid cell: \nJust like the YOLO algorithm, the SSD algorithm divides the bounding box into a 5x5 grid. Each grid cell is responsible for outputting the shape, location, color, and label of the object it contains.\n\n\n\n\nAnchor box:\n As the CNN divides the image into a grid, each cell in the grid is assigned more than one anchor box. \nSSD model uses a template matching technique during the training period to match the bounding box with each ground truth object of the image. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: \npyimagesearch.com\n\n\nHere, the predicted bounding box is drawn in red, while the ground truth bounding box (hand-labeled) is in green. As there is a high degree of overlap, this anchor box is responsible for identifying the presence of objects. The \nIntersection over Union\n (IoU) over here can be measured as\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect ratio\n: Every object has a different shape and configuration. Some are rounder and larger, while others are shrunk and shorter. The SSD architecture helps declare aspect ratios beforehand through a ratio parameter.\n\n\n\n\nZoom Level: \nThe zoom parameter can magnify smaller objects in each grid cell to identify their presence, category, and location. For example, if we need to identify a building and a park from a helicopter, we need to scale the SSD algorithm in a way that it detects both the larger and the smaller objects.\n\n\n\n\nReceptive field: \nThe receptive field is defined as the moving set of pixels of the image that the algorithm is currently working on. Different layers of a CNN model compute different regions of an input image. As it goes deeper, the size of the object increases. Just like a microscope, a CNN model magnifies every pixel of the object to compute which category it belongs to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntersection over Union\n (IoU):\n Area of overlap / Area of union \n\n\n\n\nEfficientNet\n\n\nEfficientNet \nis a convolutional neural network architecture that uniformly scales all the dimensions of an object before detecting them. These neural networks are developed at a fixed cost of application software. About the availability of resources, EfficientNet algorithms can be scaled across an application domain to achieve better object detection results.\n\n\nEfficientNet is deemed as one of the best existing CNN models for object detection as it has achieved \nstate-of-the-art accuracy \non learning datasets like \nFlowers (98.8%) \nwhile being 6.1x faster than other object detection models.\n\n\nMask R-CNN\n\n\nThis extends Faster R-CNN by pooling the region proposal network and pre-trained CNN like AlexNet. A region proposal network is a network of regions separated by bounding boxes. Mask R-CNN extracts features from the image and creates feature maps to detect the presence of objects. It also generates a high-quality mask (bounding box) for each object to separate it from the rest. \n\n\nHow does Mask R-CNN work?\n\n\nMask R-CNN was built using Faster R-CNN and Fast R-CNN. While Faster R-CNN has a softmax layer that bifurcates the outputs into two parts, a class prediction and bounding box offset,  Mask R-CNN is the addition of a third branch that describes the object mask which is the shape of the object. It is distinct from other categories and requires extraction of the object's graphical coordinates to accurately predict the location.\n\n\nMask R-CNN is a combination of two CNNs that works by pooling in a layer of object mask, also known as a Region of Interest (ROI), parallel with the existing bounding box locator.\n\n\n\n\nSource: \nviso.ai\n\n\nFeatures of Mask R-CNN\n\n\nLet’s briefly discuss a few features.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s an extremely simple model to train and runs at a speed of 5 frames per second (FPS)\n\n\nIt works miraculously well to detect human faces in different configurations.\n\n\nIt outperforms all the single model entries on every object detection task.\n\n\nMask R-CNN can easily generalize to other tasks. It can also be used to estimate human poses in a particular framework.\n\n\nIt serves as a solid baseline to create self-assist robots that will predict our future environment.\n\n\n\n\nAll supervised object detection algorithms depend on labeled datasets, which means humans must apply their knowledge to train the neural network on different inputs. Label_maps can fetch the labeled objects in a dataset () functions to infer the correct object category. \n\n\n\n\nWhat are label maps?\n\n\nThe label-map() in Tensorflow programming maps output numbers to the object class. If the output of an object detection algorithm is 4, this function scans the training data and returns the class corresponding to the number “4”. If “4” is mentioned as “airplane”, the output text will be “airplane”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject detection applications across industries \n\n\nSo far, object detection has achieved feats across critical domains like security, transport, medical, and military. Software companies use it to retrieve and categorize large relational datasets automatically to increase production efficiency. This process is also known as \ndata labeling \nor data annotation.\n\n\nHere are some real-life applications that quote the significance of AI-powered object detection systems:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice and forensic: \nObject detection can track and locate specific objects such as a person, vehicle, or backpack from frame to frame. It allows police officers and forensic professionals to inspect every nook and corner of a crime site to collect evidentiary proof. However, due to the large volume of data, the object detection process is a bit tricky and requires hours of footage to identify what can aid in the success of a case.\n\n\n\n\nContactless checkout: \nMany \nrestaurants use RFID object tracking\n to calculate the check amount by scanning empty plates. This process automatically adds the price of all the items to the total and eliminates the usual cash and credit transactions in a restaurant.\n\n\n\n\nInventory and warehousing: \nLogistics professionals can easily detect, classify, and pick up finished goods for transportation through real-time object detection.
