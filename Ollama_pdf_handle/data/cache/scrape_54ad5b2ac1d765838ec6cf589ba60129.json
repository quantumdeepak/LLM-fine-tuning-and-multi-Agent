When choosing between machine learning and deep learning, consider whether you have a powerful GPU and lots of labeled training images. If you don’t have both, a machine learning approach might be the better choice. Deep learning techniques tend to work better when you have more images, and GPUs decrease the time needed to train the model.", "extraction_method": "newspaper"}
