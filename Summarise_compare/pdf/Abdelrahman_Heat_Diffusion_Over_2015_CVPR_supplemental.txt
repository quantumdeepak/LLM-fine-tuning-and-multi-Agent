Scale Invariance

Scale invariance is a desirable property of the shape descriptor, which can be achieved
by one of the following four diﬀerent methods:

1. Trying to detect the scale, as done in most feature descriptors (e.g. SIFT) in
image analysis. However, 3D shapes are usually poorer in features and scale
detection can be done reliably only at a sparse set of feature points.

2. Through the normalization of Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues, but this method
may suﬀer if the object has missing parts [2]. In such case, the scale invariance
must be introduced locally rather than globally.

3. Using a series of transformations applied to the HKS [2] in order to avoid scale
detection. This allows creating a dense descriptor. This method is considered
local, thus can work with objects with missing parts.

4. The local equi-aﬃne invariant Laplace-Beltrami operator proposed by [3].

In this work, we propose a novel local scale normalization method based on simple
operations (thus belonging to the third category above). It was shown [2] that scaling
a shape by a factor β results in changing K(x, t) to β2 K(x, β2t).
Thus, a series of transformations are applied to W-HKS as follows. At each point
x, the W-HKS is sampled logarithmically in time (t = ατ) and the function

kτ = K(x, ατ)
(1)

is formed. Scaling the shape by β results in a time shift s = 2 logα β and amplitude
scaling by β2. That is,
k′
τ = β2kτ+s
(2)

[2] proposed to take the logarithmic transformation log k′
τ = 2 log β + log kτ+s
which decouples the multiplicative constant from kτ+s. Then they proposed to take
the derivative afterwards to remove the eﬀect of the resulting additive 2 log β term
and then taking the amplitude of the Fourier transform (FT) of the derivative to
remove the eﬀect of the time shift s. Since the derivative operator is sensitive to
noise, their method is not robust enough.
We propose to apply the Fourier transform directly to k′
τ in (2).

K′(w) = β2K(w) exp(j 2π w s).

Then taking the amplitude of the FT,

| K′(w) |= β2 | K(w) |
(4)

The eﬀect of the multiplicative constant β2 is eliminated by normalizing the | K′(w) |
by the sum of the amplitudes of the FT components. The amplitudes of the ﬁrst
signiﬁcant FT components (we normally use 6) are employed to construct the scale-
invariant shape descriptor. This proposed method eliminates the scale eﬀect without
having to use the noise-sensitive derivative operation or the logarithmic transforma-
tion that both were used in [2]. Thus, our method is simpler, more computational-
eﬃcient and more robust to noise. This is clearly veriﬁed in Figure 1 that shows the
scale-invariant heat kernel for a HK computed at a vertex of on 3D shape and another
HK computed for the same object with 3-times scale up under diﬀerent noise levels.
The two descriptors computed at the two diﬀerent scales are virtually identical using
our proposed method even at high noise levels. The method in [1] demonstrates a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the noise on the computed descriptors.

by a factor of 3. (Middle) The amplitude of the ﬁrst 15 fourier transform components

method showing complete overlapping specially in the ﬁrst four noise levels. (Right)
Similar but using the method in [1]. First row shows signal without noise. Then
noise level is increased in the subsequent rows.
